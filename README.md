Shopping Cart 
Live Demo : https://shopping-cart-7c7de.web.app/ 

The application allows users to add products to their cart, update quantities, delete products, and view the total cost and total quantity of their items.

 1) Utilized React to create reusable components for the shopping cart, including CartItem, CartList, and CartTotal, leveraging props to efficiently manage data flow within the application.
 
 2)Integrated Firebase Firestore as the database to store and manage the cart items, ensuring real-time data updates (CRUD operations) and synchronization.
